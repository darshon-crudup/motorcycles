                <h2>2022 Ducati Diavel</h2>
                    <p> Powerful. Muscular. But also agile and effective 
                        between the curves for maximum riding enjoyment. 
                        The Diavel 1260 combines the performance of a maxi-naked 
                        with the ergonomics of a muscle cruiser. Its design reinterprets 
                        the Diavel style with a contemporary look and integrates perfectly 
                        the 159 HP Testastretta DVT 1262 engine, beating heart of this new 
                        Diavel 1260. The novelty of the Model Year 22 is characterized by 
                        the choice of asymmetrical and refined graphics that combine glossy 
                         and matt black as the main colors, to which are added sporty touches 
                         in yellow, including the frame, the lower part of the tail, the 
                         dedicated seat badge and some details of the bike. The Diavel 1260 S
                          “Black and Steel” joins the S version in Thrilling Black & Dark 
                          Stealth color with red frame and black wheels, will be available 
                          in dealerships later on in 2021. The standard version is available 
                          in Dark Stealth color with black frame and black wheels.
